# HarmoniPath: AI Workflow for Burnout Career Pivoters ✨

**Built with ❤️ in AI Camp by Katia Dean**

HarmoniPath is a no-code automation project built in [n8n](https://n8n.io) designed to help tech professionals—especially those burned out from government contracting—get AI-powered career insights in minutes.

## 🧠 What It Does

This workflow takes responses from a user form and:
1. Uses a GPT-4o LLM chain to generate personalized career paths.
2. Enriches the result with Tavily web search.
3. Stores responses in Airtable for easy tracking.
4. Emails a tailored summary to the user.

> Think of it as an AI-powered career coach with workflow vibes.
